# edx-enrollments

* I wrote some SQL queries to transform and analyse the eDX_enrollments dataset.  
* The data file was taken directly from the website in its original form.  
* I built a data model (2NF) from the dataset that contains information of the users who took courses available on the eDX platform.  
* Then I tried to answer some questions about the data using the tables from the data model.
